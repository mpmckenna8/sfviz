# Visualization for SF Board of Supervisors Districts

Data for districts from
https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Current-Supervisor-Districts/8nkz-x4ny.
I'm trying to make a nice way  to look at it and explore the data. Plus maybe
add data about the upcomming elections in the odd districts this year.
